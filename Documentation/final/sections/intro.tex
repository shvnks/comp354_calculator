\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Collaboration Patterns}
        \paragraph{}
        Over the course of the beginning weeks of COMP 354, our team has met for weekly meetings every Friday at 9:00pm. Throughout these meetings, our team has had pertinent discussions regarding each team member’s role in the group, what every team member needed to accomplish for the following week and develop questions to ask the teacher assistants. These questions are then asked to the teacher’s assistant during lab times.

        \paragraph{}
        We use a group chatting platform called Discord to communicate and host meetings. We have also decided to use Github to host our software code. Github allows each team member to share the code they are working on. In the future, this will allow our team to check up on each other’s work and offer advice to one another if needed. Lab times are also used for further discussion if needed with our team. Every member of our team has been present to every single lab time.

    \subsection{Executing the Program}
        \paragraph{}
        The program is very easy to run. The only thing to do is navigate to where the tool wa downloaded, unzip the file, and double-click the ETERNITYCalculator.exe file. This will launch the calculator.
