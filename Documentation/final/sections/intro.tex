        \begin{itemize}
            \item Arccos(x): The arccosine of x is when the cosine function of x is reversed when x is in between or equal to -1 and 1. When the cosine is set up to y is equal to x, the arccosine of x equals the reversed cosine function of x, which is equal to y. \cite{arccos}
            \begin{center}
                $arccos(x) = cos^{-1}(x) = y$
            \end{center}
            \item Euler’s Number: Denoted by e, Euler’s number is a constant in mathematics approximating to 2.71828. It should be noted that e is an irrational number.\cite{boundless}
            \item Irrational Number: A number is said to be irrational if it cannot be written as a ratio of two integers. An example of this is Euler’s number. \cite{wolfram}
            \item Integer: A number that is whole. \cite{merriam}
            \item Exponent: Given a number x and exponent y, the result given by the expression $x^y$ is the value of x multiplying itself y times (i.e. the result of $2^3$ gives $2 * 2 * 2 = 8$). It should be noted that the x and y variable can themselves be functions. The same principle applies to a constant to a power of x (i.e $2^{0.98x+3}$).
            \item Hyperbolic Sine: Hyperbolic function which traces a hyperbola. Calculated through formula: (where e is Euler’s Number) \cite{encyclopaedia}
            \begin{center}
                $sinh(x) =  \frac{e^x - e^{-x}} {2}$
            \end{center}
            \item Logarithmic function: It is the inverse of an exponential function. When using the log function without an explicitly defined base, the assumed base will be 10. For simplicity sake, the natural log known as $log10(x) = ln(x)$ will not be used within the documentation.\cite{dawkins}
            \begin{center}
                $f(x) = log_b(x) = b^{f(x)}x$
            \end{center}
            \item  Mean Absolute Deviation: It is the average distance between each data point and the mean for a specific dataset. \cite{khan}
            \item Standard Deviation: A measure of how spread out the data is compared to the average. Denoted with $\sigma$. \cite{students}
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Collaboration Patterns}
        \paragraph{}
        Over the course of the beginning weeks of COMP 354, our team has met for weekly meetings every Friday at 9:00pm. Throughout these meetings, our team has had pertinent discussions regarding each team member’s role in the group, what every team member needed to accomplish for the following week and develop questions to ask the teacher assistants. These questions are then asked to the teacher’s assistant during lab times.

        \paragraph{}
        We use a group chatting platform called Discord to communicate and host meetings. We have also decided to use Github to host our software code. Github allows each team member to share the code they are working on. In the future, this will allow our team to check up on each other’s work and offer advice to one another if needed. Lab times are also used for further discussion if needed with our team. Every member of our team has been present to every single lab time.
