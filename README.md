# Comp354 Calculator Project
Description taken directly from https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kamthan/courses/comp-354/project_description.pdf

This is an elementary scientific software engineering project, with an injection of certain elements of agile methodologies. For example, the project is supposed proceed iteratively and incrementally, as well as be able to deal with novelties and uncertainties along the way.

In  the  rest  of  the  document,  both  the  project  and  the  product  are  mnemonically-named  ETERNITY.

ETERNITY involves both individual work as well as communal work.

A transcendental  function  is  a  function  that  does  not  satisfy  any  single-variable  polynomial   equation   whose   coefficients   are   themselves   roots   of   polynomials.   For   example, sin(x) is a transcendental function, but √x is not.

Let  N  be  the  size  of  a  project  team.  The  purpose  of  ETERNITY  is  to  have  a  scientific  calculator that can compute certain special functions:
The permitted set of choices is:

1.arccos(x)
2.abx3.logb(x)
4.Γ(x) (Gamma Function)
5.MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation)
6.σ (Standard Deviation)
7.sinh(x)
8.xy

In  the  foregoing,  x  and  y  are  real  variables,  and  a  and  b  are  real  constants,  unless  otherwise stated.

ETERNITY  could  be  made  general  and  useful  in  a  number  of  ways,  including  the  following: 
  - ETERNITY could include any subordinate functions developed by the team could be added  to  the  set  of  functions  mentioned  above.  (For  the  sake  of  this  
  document,  a  subordinate  function  is  a  function  that  supports  one  or  more  of  the  functions  mentioned  above.  For  example,  the  factorial  function  or 
  square  root  functions  are  subordinate functions.) ETERNITY  could  include  capability  for  parsing  and  evaluating  mathematical  expressions,  where  a 
  mathematical  expression  is  composed  of  one  or  more  of  the  functions mentioned above. (For example, 1 + log10(2) is a mathematical expression.) The project
  team could use a mature, open, publicly-available library for parsing.
